We use a V8 revision that has been used for a Chromium release.

We're using WebKit r58033, as used by
http://src.chromium.org/svn/releases/5.0.387.0/DEPS
This requires http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4465 but this version has a
crashing bug for ARM. Instead we use http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4588,
which is used by http://src.chromium.org/svn/releases/6.0.399.0/DEPS
